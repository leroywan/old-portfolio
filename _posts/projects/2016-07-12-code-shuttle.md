This is a WordPress theme I created for my web development business called Code Shuttle. The idea of this website is to provide site visitors the best user experience while giving them a solid understanding of what the business is about. In addition, I wanted to use this website as an example site to show site visitors what I can do and how their website can be redesigned to be mobile responsive and modern looking.

<strong>My plan for this website:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Create an eye catching front page (using <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/project/2016/07/19/type-animation.html">type-animation</a> and parallax scrolling)</li>
	<li>Feedback for all clickable elements</li>
	<li>SVG images for all graphics</li>
	<li>Subtle yet effective animations for images</li>
	<li>SEO by Yoast</li>
	<li>Contact form and blog page</li>
	<li>Mutliple fields for content editing</li>
	<li>Hosting on digital ocean droplet</li>
</ul>

<strong>And the results...</strong>

The design of this website did not turn out as well as I had hoped. The animations seemed a bit excessive while images and icons/images were used very sparingly. However, the backend and admin panel for this website is made fairly simple to use and content can be added and modified easily. 

It may not have been a wise decision to use a full blown CMS such as WordPress for my website since I don't really need much of a backend besides querying posts from a database. An alternative to a CMS would be a static site generator which would fit my needs a lot more and would even give me a faster load time. This website will soon be redesigned and more features will be included in the new version.
